General
========

For each of your team's implementations, explain the following (where appropriate and applicable):

- details on calling conventions, input and output data formats, limitations, bugs, and special features.
- negative aspects of your program (limitations, known bugs)
- positive aspects (extensions, special features)
- describe your choice of modularization (abstractions), data structures, and algorithms
- explain anything you did that is likely to be different from what other students may have done
- justify any design decisions for which the rationale isn't immediately clear

Feel free to modify the structure of this `readme.html` file to fit the current assignment and to fit how you wish to present your findings.



Submission
-----------

Create a zip file that contains all of your code, this `readme.html` document, and any additional files of evidence (ex: screenshots, scenes).

If helpful, use folders to divide up the subparts of your submission.

Assignment Details
===================


Describe the `Node` data type you used to implement the 2d tree data structure.

<!-- Details and screenshots here -->


Describe your method for nearest neighbor search in a kd tree.

<!-- Details and screenshots here -->


Using the 64-bit memory cost model from the textbook and lecture, give the total memory usage in bytes of your 2d tree data structure as a function of the number of points $N$.
Use tilde notation to simplify your answer (i.e., keep the leading coefficient and discard lower-order terms).
Include the memory for all referenced objects (including `Node` and `Point` objects) except for `Value` objects (because the type is unknown and the object is owned by the client).
Also, include the memory for all referenced objects, including any references to the `Direction` enum.

bytes per `Point`:

bytes per `PSKDTree` of $N$ points: $\sim N$

<!-- Details and screenshots here -->


How many nearest neighbor calculations can your brute-force implementation perform per second for `input100K.txt` (100,000 points) and `input1M.txt` (1 million points), where the query points are random points in the unit square?
Explain how you determined the operations per second.
(Do not count the time to read in the points from file or to build the data structure.)

Repeat the question but with the 2d tree implementation.

file            | brute force | 2d tree
----------------|-------------|---------
`input100K.txt` |         $0$ |     $0$
`input1M.txt`   |         $0$ |     $0$

Reflection
===========

Describe whatever help (if any) that you received.
Don't include readings, lectures, but do include any help from people (including course staff, lab TAs, classmates, and friends)  and attribute them by name.

<!-- Details and screenshots here -->


Since this is an individual assignment, if you worked with a partner, assert below that the work you are turning in is your own work, and that you only did "whiteboard" work as a group.
Give one sentence explaining what each of you contributed.
If you used the code from the lab challenge, explain what is shared between you and your lab partner.

<!-- Details and screenshots here -->



Describe any serious problems you encountered.

<!-- Details and screenshots here -->


List any other comments here.
Feel free to provide any feedback on how much you learned from doing the assignment, and whether you enjoyed doing it.
