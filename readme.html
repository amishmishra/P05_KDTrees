General
========

For each of your team's implementations, explain the following (where appropriate and applicable):

- details on calling conventions, input and output data formats, limitations, bugs, and special features.
- negative aspects of your program (limitations, known bugs)
- positive aspects (extensions, special features)
- describe your choice of modularization (abstractions), data structures, and algorithms
- explain anything you did that is likely to be different from what other students may have done
- justify any design decisions for which the rationale isn't immediately clear

Feel free to modify the structure of this `readme.html` file to fit the current assignment and to fit how you wish to present your findings.

Assignment Details
===================


Describe the `Node` data type you used to implement the 2d tree data structure.

<!-- Details and screenshots here -->
Our Node contained the location of the point, the value assigned to the node, as well as references to the nodes on its direct left and right, and the direction which is either left right or up down.

Describe your method for nearest neighbor search in a kd tree.

<!-- Details and screenshots here -->
In our implementation of nearest neighbor we created a maximum priority queue that contains the k number of nearest nodes. It goes through the tree and compares the node with the max in the maxPQ. We traverse the tree recursively using a pruning method, which will not go down a direction that we know will not be nearer than the ones already in the maxPQ.

Using the 64-bit memory cost model from the textbook and lecture, give the total memory usage in bytes of your 2d tree data structure as a function of the number of points $N$.
Use tilde notation to simplify your answer (i.e., keep the leading coefficient and discard lower-order terms).
Include the memory for all referenced objects (including `Node` and `Point` objects) except for `Value` objects (because the type is unknown and the object is owned by the client).
Also, include the memory for all referenced objects, including any references to the `Direction` enum.

bytes per `Point`:

-16 bytes object overhead
-2 doubles x 8 bytes = 16 bytes
-this is a multiple of 8! we're good.

Point: 32 bytes

bytes per `PSKDTree` of $N$ points: $\sim N$

<!-- Details and screenshots here -->
private class Node {                // 16 object overhead
Point p;                        // 8 bytes reference to a Point
Value v;                        // skip
Node left, right;               // 2 x 8 bytes reference to a Node = 16 bytes
Partition.Direction dir;        // 8 bytes reference to the Partition.Direction boolean
}                                   // 48 bytes (a multiple of 8!)

put:
ArrayList<Point> of N Points: 8 bytes for each Point reference * N
    +
    8 bytes ref to Node * N
    =16*N



    How many nearest neighbor calculations can your brute-force implementation perform per second for `input100K.txt` (100,000 points) and `input1M.txt` (1 million points), where the query points are random points in the unit square?
    Explain how you determined the operations per second.
    (Do not count the time to read in the points from file or to build the data structure.)

    Repeat the question but with the 2d tree implementation.

    file                    |             brute force               |      2d tree
    --------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|---------------
    `input100K.txt` (avg'd of 10k runs)   |                $275$                  |     $1170$
    `input1M.txt` (avg'd over 1000 runs)  |                $22.7$                 |     $54.3$

    <!-- Details and screenshots here -->
    We read in the input text files and set the values to a double array. Then, we placed a pair of values from the text file into a new
    Point, which we then inserted into our PointSearch constructor. From there, we ran a large number of tests setting a stop watch before
    running a nearest() call on a random point (made with Point.uniform(). The time is recorded in seconds, so taking the inverse of one of
    these time recordings reports the number of nearest calls that took place in 1 second. I averaged the elapsed time over the testing size
    to get more reliable results, and took the inverse of that to get the # operations/second.

    Reflection
    ===========
    Describe whatever help (if any) that you received.
    Don't include readings, lectures, but do include any help from people (including course staff, lab TAs, classmates, and friends)  and attribute them by name.
    <!-- Details and screenshots here -->
    Edric Yu answered questions and helped with debugging. He noticed that our get function was wrong, because the Burger King locator was returning the wrong locations. That was a pretty funny catch.

    Since this is an individual assignment, if you worked with a partner, assert below that the work you are turning in is your own work, and that you only did "whiteboard" work as a group.
    Give one sentence explaining what each of you contributed.
    If you used the code from the lab challenge, explain what is shared between you and your lab partner.

    <!-- Details and screenshots here -->
    This was a group assignment, soo... We also uses GitHub to work as a group on things.

    Describe any serious problems you encountered.

    <!-- Details and screenshots here -->


    List any other comments here.
    Feel free to provide any feedback on how much you learned from doing the assignment, and whether you enjoyed doing it.
